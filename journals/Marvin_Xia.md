- Created the backend of the signup page over the break utilizing MongoDB. Did not work as much as I had hoped and spent more time reviewing old explorations to keep on track.

7/10/2022
- deleted signup backend; mongoDB was not needed and there was a miscommunication on my part
- worked on scores endpoint and set up a POST but having issues with repository creation and getting the proper container to get set up after class. Will check with Jorge the following day since he was able to get his questions database set up
